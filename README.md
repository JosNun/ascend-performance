# Ascend Performance

As noted on the [about page](https://ascend.netlify.com/about), Ascend Performance is a fictitious company. This is merely a website I built as a project to test out new technologies and expand my portfolio. 

The front-end stack includes: 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
